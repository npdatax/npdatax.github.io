<p>
                    <b> Migration : </b> In this project, we will focus on temporal analysis from past years to present on mass migration, 
                    brain drain, and other movements. Based on skills that the young generation are gaining, 
                    we can predict when the incoming generation will be capable of bringing transformation to Nation.

<p>
                     <b> Corruption : </b> This project will use the simulator to create hypothetical data under a typical social, 
                     bureaucratic and political scenario. Simulated data will be used to create a complex network. 
                     Using Machine Learning techniques in the complex system, a corruption detection algorithm will
                     be developed. The model will systematically study the networking and activities of the member 
                     up to the nth degree of relationship in the graph. For example, a politician's relative/friends 
                     within a sphere of influence, get an abrupt increase in property value will add the probability 
                     to the politician being corrupted.

<p>
                    <b> Smart Governance : </b> We will use both simulation and Machine Learning. This will be a toy model of sustainable development
                    including entrepreneurship, health, and education. We will take a small population and recognize the 
                    most contributing features for example production, market value, public interest, cultural value, etc. 
                    Using a simulator, we will generate hypothetical entrepreneurship opportunity and integrate hypothetical
                    health insurance and student loan in a single model. Features designed in the model are feed into a
                    mathematical model for evolutionary simulation purpose. We will select a time frame of 5 to 10 years 
                    and view how a selection of different parameters controls the economic growth of the population. 
                    The result of this model will give us the idea of how can a community improve their financial condition
                    along with secure health and education through entrepreneurship.

<p>
                    <b> Budget and Expenditure : </b> In this project, we will focus on National Budget Data. There are some 
                    impressive data structure in governmental data blend with the bureaucratic tree structure. Based on past
                    data on plan and expenditure, an AI-based algorithm can be developed to track how efficiently the government
                    is making in the future budget.

<p>
                    <b> Population Census: </b> We will study open data available on population census and other exciting data regarding the temporal and spatial relationship. 
                    The study of poverty, literacy and time evolution of political attitude of large mass can be studied.
